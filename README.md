# Village Strategy Game

A real-time strategy game where you build and manage a village, expand your territory, and survive as long as possible. Manage resources, construct buildings, recruit units, and expand your influence across a hexagonal map.

## 🎮 How to Play

### Objective

Build and expand your village while managing resources. Avoid starvation by maintaining positive food production. The longer you survive, the higher your score!

### Getting Started

1. **Start the game**: Click on your village (the tile with a house icon in the center) to open the village panel
2. **Build your first building**: Start with a Farm to increase food production
3. **Manage resources**: Keep an eye on your resource production rates (hold Shift while hovering over resources)
4. **Expand your territory**: Click on visible tiles adjacent to your owned tiles to claim them
5. **Upgrade tiles**: Click on owned tiles to upgrade them and increase their production bonuses

### Resources

The game features six types of resources:

- **Food** 🍎 - Essential for survival. Each person consumes 1 food per minute. Base production: +5/min
- **Wood** 🪵 - Used for construction and upgrades. Base production: +3/min
- **Stone** ⛏️ - Required for advanced buildings and upgrades. Base production: +1/min
- **Diamond** 💎 - Rare resource for high-tier upgrades. Obtained from special tiles and buildings
- **Technology** 🔬 - Research points for advancement. Generated by libraries and military buildings
- **Power** ⚔️ - Military strength. Required to claim new tiles and villages. Generated by military units

### Buildings

Build and upgrade buildings in your village to boost resource production:

- **Farm** 🌾 - Increases food production (+2/m per level)
- **Lumbermill** 🌲 - Increases wood production (+1.5/m per level)
- **Quarry** 🔨 - Increases stone production (+1/m per level)
- **Mine** 💎 - Increases diamond production (+0.5/m per level)
- **Library** 📚 - Increases technology production (+0.3/m per level)
- **Home** 🏠 - Increases population limit (+5 per level)
- **Barracks** ⚔️ - Train warriors and generate technology (+1/m per level)
- **Archer Guild** 🏹 - Train archers and generate technology (+1/m per level)
- **Mage Tower** ✨ - Train mages and generate technology (+1/m per level)

### Units

Recruit military units to generate power and technology:

- **Warrior** ⚔️ - Generates 1 power and 1 research point
- **Archer** 🏹 - Generates 3 power and 2 research points
- **Mage** ✨ - Generates 5 power and 3 research points

### Guild Masters

Hire specialized masters to boost resource production by 2% per master:

- **Master Farmer** 🌾 - Boosts food production
- **Master Lumberjack** 🌲 - Boosts wood production
- **Master Stonemason** 🔨 - Boosts stone production
- **Master Miner** 💎 - Boosts diamond production
- **Master Scholar** 📚 - Boosts technology production

### Map & Territory

- **Hexagonal Map**: Explore and expand across a hexagonal grid
- **Claim Tiles**: Click on visible tiles adjacent to your territory to claim them
- **Upgrade Tiles**: Click on owned tiles to upgrade them (up to level 100)
- **Claim Villages**: Conquer AI villages to expand your influence (requires significant power)
- **Tile Types**: Different terrain types provide different resource bonuses

### Game Controls

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **`** (Backtick) - Toggle pause/play
- **1** - Set speed to 1x
- **2** - Set speed to 5x
- **3** - Set speed to 20x

#### Mouse Controls

- **Click** - Interact with tiles (claim, upgrade, open village panel)
- **Drag** - Pan the map
- **Scroll** - Zoom in/out (or use zoom controls)

#### UI Controls

- **Time Display** - Click to open dropdown menu with reset and test options
- **Speed Controls** - Adjust game speed (1x, 5x, 20x)
- **Pause Button** - Pause/resume the game
- **Resource Display** - Hover to see details, hold Shift for production breakdown

### Tips & Strategy

1. **Start with Farms**: Food is critical - build farms early to avoid starvation
2. **Manage Population**: Build homes to increase population limit, but remember each person consumes food
3. **Balance Production**: Don't focus on just one resource - you'll need all of them
4. **Upgrade Strategically**: Tile upgrades increase production bonuses significantly
5. **Build Military**: Power is required to claim new tiles and villages
6. **Use Speed Controls**: Speed up time when waiting for resources or building completion
7. **Watch Production Rates**: Hold Shift over resources to see detailed production breakdown
8. **Plan Building Queue**: You have limited building job slots - plan your construction carefully

### Game Over

The game ends when:

- Food reaches 0
- Food production is 0 or negative
- No farms are being built that could increase food production

Your final score is calculated based on:

- Village level
- Experience gained
- Building levels
- Units recruited
- Guild masters hired
- Resources spent
- **Penalty**: Game time (surviving longer reduces score)

### Auto-Save

Your game progress is automatically saved to browser localStorage every 10 seconds. Refresh the page to continue where you left off!

- Tile upgrade system (levels 1-100)

#### Resource System

- Base production from village
- Tile bonuses from owned tiles
- Building bonuses from constructed buildings
- Population consumption for food
- Speed multiplier affects all production
